    Build a dark-themed, cyberpunk-style web dashboard called 0xRootPanel, powered by React + Tailwind CSS (with optional Framer Motion or GSAP). This dashboard is for a cybersecurity/devops engineer to monitor, access, and control self-hosted apps across multiple machines in a private infrastructure.

üíÄ Visual Aesthetic:

    Hacker/Matrix/Cyberpunk UI

    Black background with neon accents (green, red, purple, electric blue)

    Animated glitch text effects (on titles, on hover)

    Terminal-style monospace font (e.g., Fira Code, JetBrains Mono)

    Use ASCII-like animations or borders

    Optional command-line simulation intro animation (like logging into a secured system)

üß© Functional Requirements:

    Dynamic App Grid (animated)
    Each app shows:

        App name (glitched or typewriter effect)

        Icon or emoji (or SVG logo support)

        Description

        Clickable URL

        Status ping (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚è≥) using fetch() with live response time display (e.g., 184ms)

    Config File (JSON-based)
    Load app data from apps.json. Example:

    [
      {
        "name": "NeuralHunt",
        "description": "AI Malware Scanner",
        "url": "http://192.168.50.100:8081",
        "icon": "üß†",
        "status_endpoint": "http://192.168.50.100:8081/health"
      },
      {
        "name": "Proxmox",
        "description": "VM & Container Control Node",
        "url": "https://192.168.50.5:8006",
        "icon": "üñ•Ô∏è"
      }
    ]

    Real-Time Status Checks

        Ping endpoint or URL every 30‚Äì60 seconds

        Color-coded borders (green = online, red = offline, blue = checking)

        Show latency in ms

    Dark/Light Mode (optional toggle)
    Default: dark mode hacker theme

    Simple Passphrase Login

        One-time login using a passcode like rootnull2025

        Store in localStorage, optional config in JSON

    Docker Support

        Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for local or homelab hosting

        Mount the config file as a volume for easy edits

üß† Optional Elite Features:

    /admin route with a secure UI to edit the JSON config (CRUD)

    Keyboard shortcuts for fast navigation (Ctrl+Shift+D to toggle dark/light, F5 to force refresh all statuses)

    Easter eggs (Konami code shows hidden 0xRootNull badge or system info)

    Optional system tray widget using Tauri or Electron in the future
